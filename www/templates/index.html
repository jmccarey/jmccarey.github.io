          <p>
            My name is Joseph McCarey, but I most often go by Joey. I am a passionate maker with a mission of creating
            impactful products anywhere I find a need for them. I hold a bachelor's degree in computer science and a
            language citation in Mandarin from Harvard University. Currently, I am seeking out employment opportunities for
            full-stack or multidisciplinary work.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I would say that my primary skill is problem
            solving, programming is a tool I use often and got an early start on learning. My first experience writing code came at around age 10, when I wanted to learn how video games were made and started following along with YouTube tutorials. When it came time for high school, I was lucky enough to get into
            Lane Tech in Chicago-- which has an outstanding computer science department and the option to concentrate in
            the field for your plan of study. It was at Lane Tech that I learned about multidisciplinary fields like
            mechatronics and robotics, practiced engineering and design skills, and properly became a maker.
            When I got to Harvard, I took some time to explore electrical and mechanical engineering, but ultimately
            decided to continue concentrating in computer science.
          </p>
          <p>
            Computer science at Harvard was a culture shock for me because, while I was a solid practical programmer
            before college, the assignments ended up being more typesetting math with LaTeX than writing code. Though
            the math was manageable and interesting, many of my classes left me really missing making things that people
            were going to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to satisfy my desire for more practical work during college, I explored extracurriculars for my
            first couple years-- then moved on to freelancing and making small batch products to sell as mini
            passion projects. I continued the latter work until 2024, when my home situation briefly required full time
            care. Since then, I have begun to seek out a stable full time job.

      <h1 class="mb-3">About
        <small>this website</small>
      </h1>
      <p>This website is the second iteration of a portfolio site that I originally launched back in 2019. The intent is
        to serve as a centralized hub for documenting my projects in a reader friendly format, and to potentially host
        some apps in the future. Some neat features of this site include dynamic styling for dark mode and switching to
        a mobile oriented navigation bar, and a custom backend for quickly updating the projects section.</p>
      <p>In the projects section, each page contains profiles for a few projects-- including a description, and often
        pictures and links. The pages and projects appear in no particular order, but I've made an effort to group
        projects thematically. The listed projects are not all inclusive of my work, or even my recent work, and some
        projects may never be listed in the interest of employer/client privacy. On the contact page, there are several
        avenues for contacting me. Feel free to reach out for any reason-- especially if you find a bug on this website.
        A general, public version of my resume is also available on this site. A more updated version or tailored
        version is available upon request.</p>

      <h1 class="mb-3">About
        <small>ongoing projects</small>
      </h1>
      <p>After years of focusing on college work, extracurriculars, and generally helping other people with their
        projects, I am excited to finally have more time to resume working on passion projects. I generally use my
        passion projects as an opportunity to comfortably learn new skills or brush up on those I haven't used in a
        while. Following that trend, I am currently in the process of getting more comfortable with Go and Rust by
        writing a simple cross-platform pathing game and a desktop password recovery tool, respectively.
